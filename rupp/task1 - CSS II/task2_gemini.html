Task 2: Compilation

CSS compilation is the process of converting preprocessor code (like Sass or LESS) into standard CSS that can be understood by browsers. This compilation typically involves parsing the preprocessor code, evaluating variables and functions, and generating the corresponding CSS output.

How compilation works:

Parsing: The preprocessor reads the source code and analyzes its structure.
Evaluation: Variables and functions are evaluated, and their values are substituted into the code.
Generation: The preprocessor generates the equivalent CSS code based on the parsed and evaluated source code.
Example:

SCSS
// Sass code
$base-font-size: 16px;

body {
  font-size: $base-font-size;
}

// Compiled CSS
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}
