<!-- Task 1: CSS Processor
Explanation:
A CSS processor is a tool that enhances the capabilities of standard CSS by 
allowing developers to use features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions. 
This leads to more maintainable and modular CSS code.

Popular CSS Preprocessors:
Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
LESS
Stylus
Advantages of Using a CSS Processor:
Modularity: Break styles into smaller, manageable pieces.
Maintainability: Use variables for colors and sizes to maintain consistency.
Nesting: Allows writing CSS in a hierarchical structure, making it easier to read.
Mixins and Functions: Reuse styles and create complex styles with functions.
Code Example:
Without Preprocessor: -->
.button {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
}

.button-primary {
    background-color: darkblue;
}

<!-- With Sass: -->
$primary-color: blue;
$primary-dark: darkblue;

.button {
    background-color: $primary-color;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
}

.button-primary {
    background-color: $primary-dark;
}
