Task 2: Compilation
Definition:
CSS compilation is the process of converting Sass or LESS code into standard CSS that browsers can understand. This process includes parsing the preprocessor syntax, resolving variables, and generating the final CSS output.

Steps to Compile Sass to CSS:
Write Sass code in a .scss file.
Use a Sass compiler (like sass command-line tool or build tools like Webpack) to compile the code.
The compiler processes the Sass file and outputs a .css file.
Example:
Sass Code (styles.scss):

scss
Copy code
$color: red;

.button {
    background-color: $color;
}
Compiled CSS Output (styles.css):

css
Copy code
.button {
    background-color: red;
}
