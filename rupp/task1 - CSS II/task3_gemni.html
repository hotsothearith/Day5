Task 3: Sass Basics

Sass is a CSS extension language that adds features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions to CSS. It offers a more flexible and powerful way to write stylesheets.

Differences from regular CSS:

Nesting: Sass allows you to nest selectors within each other, improving code organization and readability.
Variables: You can define variables to store values like colors, fonts, and dimensions, making it easier to manage styles.
Mixins: Mixins are reusable code blocks that can be included in other stylesheets, reducing redundancy.
Imports: You can import external Sass files into your main stylesheet, promoting modularity and organization.
Example:

SCSS
// Sass code
// _button.scss (partial)
.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

// main.scss
@import "button";

.primary-button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

// Compiled CSS
.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.primary-button {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}
